                    Turkish Citizenship by investment is one of the coveted ones in the world. Turkiye has one of the
                    fast-growing economies among the G20 countries. The universal healthcare, low cost of living, ease
                    to open a business, and increasing number of tourist visitors make the country attractive to many
                    foreign nationals to settle in Turkiye. The young and skilled population is also a magnet for
                    companies to set up a branch here. The transportation infrastructure is one of the best if not great

                    citizenship program gives that opportunity.
